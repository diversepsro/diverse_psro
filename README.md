# Diverse PSRO

### Diverse PSRO

> Diverse PSRO is a variation of the Policy Space Response Oracle algorithm which promotes training a behaviourally diverse set of policies by using the theory of determinantal 
point processes (DPPs). This approach allows to train less exploitable more diverse strategies as well as bringing a new geometrically interpretable way of measuring 
population diversity.



### How to run Diverse PSRO

### Performance of Diverse PSRO

> Diverse PSRO is evaluated in three different setting, each of them using a different version of diverse oracle.
